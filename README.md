## Problem statement
Develop a solution for hostel management. The solution should provide features for allocation of room to the, Reallocation of room, no of rooms empty, no of students from a particular institute in a particular hostel building etc. The application should allow report generation (student wise, building wise, no of rooms empty /occupied etc.) The solution should assume more than one hostel building, number of floors in each building. Number of rooms on each floor. Requirements on each floor.

### Introduction 
For the past few years, there is a rapid increase in the number of educational institutions which led to the increase in number of hostels to accommodate students.
The existing Hostel Management System is manual and involves a lot of paperwork and is hence very time consuming.
To make this process easier, the idea is to develop an Online Hostel Management System for managing various activities in the hostel.
The application is very user friendly and does not require any technical expertise to operate it.
